# Speech-Enabled-Wikipedia-Viewer

[Finished product](http://codepen.io/chimp-v6/pen/zrvEby)

Freecodecamp's [Build a Wikipedia Viewer](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer) Zipline.

The voice commands were made possible by Annyang.js.

The first iteration looked and behaved nothing like the current version. What began as a static search and here's-your-results, evolved into an obsession to bring convenience to the world. Feedback very welcome.
